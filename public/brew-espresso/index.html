      <h2><i class="icon-beaker"></i>Espresso</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Make sure the espresso beans are loaded into the grinder.</li>
          <li>Rest the filter holder on the metal brackets and press the button on the lower left side to fill it with ground coffee.</li>
          <li>Using the metal tamper, press down on the coffee in the filter holder so it's tightly compacted.</li>
          <li>Secure the filter holder into its housing by inserting it straight up into the distribution unit 
and turning it to the right to lock it in place.  Do not rest your hand on the distribution unit for 
leverage.  Itâ€™s freaking hot.</li>
          <li>Read the boiler gauge: it should be in between 1 and 1.2.  If it is lower than 1, increase the 
pressure by pulling down on the steam tap.  You should do this quickly, but you may need to do 
it two or three times.  When you do this, please make sure that the steam nozzle is tucked in 
towards the machine for your safety.</li>
          <li>Once the boiler gauge reaches the correct point, press the coffee distribution button on the 
top right to begin the espresso shot.</li>
          <li>You must press the coffee distribution button again to stop the flow of espresso. 
Please find 2-ounce espresso glasses to the right of the machine if you'd like a precise 
measurement.  You can also use these glasses to draw the espresso and pour it into a larger 
cup of hot or cold milk, if you want a cup of coffee that's too big to fit under the filter holder.</li>
          <li>When you are done, please be considerate.  Knock the coffee grounds out of the filter holder 
into the knock box and rinse out the filter holder.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>Please Note: The green and yellow lights must both be on at all times. If the  yellow light is off, please 
        remove the plastic water tank in the back of the machine and refill it.</p>
