      <h2><i class="icon-fire"></i>Milk Steamer</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Secure the thermometer onto one of the metal pitchers and pour the liquid in.</li>
        <li>Maneuver the steam nozzle so that it's submerged in the pitcher and the pitcher can rest on 
the metal grate.</li>
        <li>Release the steam by pulling down on the steam tap continually.  You'll see the temperature 
on the thermometer begin to rise.  Ideal steamed milk temperature is between 140 and 160 
degrees Fahrenheit, which is highlighted on the thermometer for your convenience.</li>

        <li>When your milk is at your desired temperature, let go of the tap and carefully remove the 
pitcher out from under the nozzle.  Seriously, be careful.  The nozzle will be very hot.</li>
        <li>If you want to make froth for a cappuccino, move the nozzle forward and carefully tilt the 
pitcher on an angle while you hold down the steam tap.  Try to get the steam nozzle as close 
to the top of the liquid while still remaining submerged.  This takes a lot of practice.  We should 
train and then have a big froth contest.</li>
        <li>It is imperative that you wipe the steam nozzle clean immediately after use.  Dried milk 
and soy milk are difficult to clean and can clog the nozzle before you can say “Gee whiz, that 
clogged the nozzle.”  There are several dishrags located in the top drawer, third from the right 
for this purpose.  </li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>Bezzera Silverman also comes equipped with a hot water tap to prepare hot tea 
    and Americano coffee. It’s located in the center between the steam tap and the 
    distribution unit.</p>
